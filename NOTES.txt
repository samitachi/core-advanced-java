Maven(is a Build Tool)

--> With time dependencies gets older, which needs to be replaced with newer ones. Afer replacing, project needs to be compiled, installed, build and deployed. Maven takes 
    care of all these. It migrates the project to newer versions.
-->When a java application is writen it needs to be compiled,run, build , deploy etc. to get an output. Maven makes these tasks automated.
-->Mave is conrtolled from POM.xml file. (Project Object Model) which contains the configurations.It is known as heart of maven.
-->Maven are the plugins which are available online.
-->When maven reads the pom.xml file, it downloads the dependencies(jar files and plugins) from the repositories. Repositories is like a location where various jar files are stored.
-->Type of repositories--local, remote,central/online etc. 
-->These are stored on the server.
-->Maven downloads all the jar files from the repository and puts inside our project or inside the local repository.So that if in case same jar file are required, it will not download from
   global repository rather from local repository.
-->Whatever configurations, (not only dependencies) that are put inside pom.xml file are handled by Maven.
